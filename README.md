# ipfp_R

`ipfp_homoskedastic.R` provides an `R` version of the IPFP solver for the Choo and Siow 2006 model of the marriage market with perfectly transferable utility. This relies on a separable specification with type I EV iid errors. 

The main routine is `solveipfp`. The code file ends with an example that you can use to test the function by changing `runExample` to `T`.
